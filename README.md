### What is Mu'adhin?
- Mu'adhin is an ics generator that allows users to generate an ics file (or add on to google and outlook calendar) that contains the prayer times for a specific location with the very crucially added feature of including dates, times and locations of both UNSWMSA and ISOC events for uni students.
### Inspiration for the project
- When I came to Uni as a fresh muslim revert, one of the biggest things i struggled with was finding a community of muslims that I could hang out with. I'm gonna be honest, I still don't have a muslim group that I see extremely often but we make do I guess you know.
- Anyways it took me quite a while after converting to establish habits like praying, reading Qur'an, making wudhu, all these things. 
- A combination of the above two reasons is what inspired me to start creating Mu'adhin. I wanted to make it easier for muslims to establish habits like praying and attending events by making it easier for them to know when and where these events are happening.
    - Especially for reverts this can be very important, as not only does it make it easier for them to establish habits, but it also makes it easier for them to find a community of muslims to hang out with.
    - Keeps them away from a lot of Haram activities that they might otherwise be doing. Instead they are hanging around in a Halal environment, Alhamdulillah.
